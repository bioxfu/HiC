# Post-Lachesis step: Take the Lachesis output orderings/orientations and use them to create a new fasta file.
#
# Syntax:
# CreateScaffoldedFasta.pl <assembly-fasta-file> <OUTPUT_DIR>
#
# Inputs:
# -- Assembly fasta file.
# -- Lachesis OUTPUT_DIR; must have a subdirectory main_results/ containig a file clusters.by_name.txt and a file group*.ordering for each group
#
# Outputs:
# -- A file "Lachesis_assembly.fasta" in OUTPUT_DIR
